# Definition
* AI = It enables the machine to think
* ML = Its subset of AI. It provides statistical tools to explore & analyze the data. 
* DL = Its subset of ML. Multi Neural Network Architecture. 
* Data Science = Data Scientist. Mathematical tools such as Statistics, Probability, Linear Alzebra

# To Read
* AI is a bigger concept to create intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking capability and behavior, whereas, machine learning is an application or subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data without being programmed explicitly.
* Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without being explicitly programmed.
* Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence.
* Artificial Intelligence = Artificial ( Human made ) + Intelligence ( Thinking power ) 
* Clustering is the process of grouping similar entities together
* Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem

# Machine Learning can be
1. Suerpvised = Past Labled Data
2. Un Supervised = No Past Labled Data. Clustering techniques / Alogirthams ( K-mean Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN Clustering ) . 
3. Semi Supervised ( Reinforcement ) = Suerpvised + Un Supervised
# Deep Learning can be
1. ANN ( Artificial Neural Network )  --- Input data form is "Numbers"
2. CNN ( Convolutional Neural Network ) --- Input data form is "Images". TL ( Transfer Learning )
3. RNN ( Recurrent Neural Network ) --- Input data form is "Time Series"
 

# Prerequisite
